            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">
        
            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can
                pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has
                no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He
                will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is
                also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <h2>Sage</h2>
            <img src="images/sage_classic.jpeg" width="400" alt="A smiling golden retriever lying on the bed">
        
            <p>Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs. She loves sneaking into the bedroom and hopping
            onto the neatest bed. She also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling the wind and air. She enjoys walking,
            only if you take her for a ride to a big arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily her cup
            of tea.</p>
            <p>Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the dining table, which was surprising because she is
            normally gentle and polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by herself. Unfortunately, the
            corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended up vomiting it all later.</p>
